# Game design and psuedocode

## Overview
* There are three levels to choose from, First grade📖, Regular📚, and Hard 📝
* The levels progress from short to long words/phrase
* Only one player
* Player guesses one letter at a time
* Player can use hint button to make a hint appear in console
* The player starts with 3 stars ⭐⭐⭐
* A star is lost when you guess 6 letters wrong in the word/phrase or use a hint 
* The game ends when all stars are lost
 
## Scoring
* To lose a star you have to get six letters wrong in the word/phrase
* When a level is lost and all 3 stars are lost, the game restart and returns to home screen

## How to play the game
To play in first grade mode players can click the button 'Start Game' or click on 'Level' button to choose other levels.
Players try to guess the hidden word/phrase by guessing one letter at a time by typing the letter on the keyboard.
Players can press the button 'Use Hint' and it will aperar a hint on the console to help.
Play click try again, to try the phrase again. Players quite game, by clicking on quit button.

 Milestones:
1. Have an instructions screen, and game board with images, and hints Nov 9
2. Make the keys work to guess letters Nov 10
3. Have a working timer Nov 13
5. Sound effects / colours (final touches)  Nov 15


Project:
1. Starting Page (with name of the game)
2. Level screen (  1^ grade, regular and hard ) 
3. Instructions 
4. Game board screen + images + hints (2 > regular, 1> hard) + timer + Worng guessse in red + Buttons for start, restart, quit, hint button  + (if we have time) squares (6 wrong guesses and you lose) + winnwer text 
 
 1^ grade:
 1. Game board screen + images + hints (3)+  Worng guessse in red + Buttons for start, restart, quit + (if we have time) squares (7 wrong guesses and you lose) + winnwer text 
 2. Sounds of typing when you press keys 
 3. Colored boxes above the word 

Instructions to win 1^ grade:
1. You have three starts: to get 1 you have to guess two words, if you guess a letter wrong 7 times, you lose one stars

Instructions to win regular and hard: 
1. You have three starts: to get 1 you have to guess two words, if you guess a letter wrong 7 times, you lose one stars
2. timer to see who's more fast
